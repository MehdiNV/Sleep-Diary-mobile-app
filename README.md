### By Mehdi Naderi Varandi
##### (This was originally for University, in particular the CSC3122 'Mobile Computer Systems Development' - more in-depth README & documentation coming soon!)


Project made for the module's coursework assessment. This is a Sleep Diary application that has the following features:
* Login and Registeration mechanisms 
* Storage capability for data permanence 
* Secure storage of credentials and data
* Visualisation of data (e.g. charts)
* Beautiful UI (Input widgets, toast notifications, etc)
* Smooth user experience (nuances and small parts covered to make user experience easy)

Tech (at brief glance):
* React Native
* Redux

More documentation is coming soon (to replace ordinary documents that were given to institution!). For any questions, please contact me at _MehdiNV@hotmail.com_
